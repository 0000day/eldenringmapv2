## Building the app
 - npm install
 - npm run package-win  

Full running app will be in the dist-folder.

## What this is about
Have at least 2 monitors.  
Have fun playing & enjoy having a fully controllable map on the side.

## Controls (default on numpad)
Switch map overground <=> underground: __/__  
Move map: __up/down/left/right__  
Checkboxes up/down: __7 and 1__  
Check/Uncheck: __9__

You can customize your hotkeys in the config.json  
Project: `root/config.json`  
Compiled: `./resources/app/config.json`

## Known issues
### Keys not working:
 - Change numpad-lock state and try again
 - Click the map once and then go back to your game

I don't actively plan to continue from this point on.  
Maybe the two other maps will be implemented. Wanna do it yourself? Check `preload.js:158`.
